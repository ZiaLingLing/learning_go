## 🧠 Go Concepts Used

This project serves as a practical introduction to core Go concepts, including:

- **Slices** – used to store and manage dynamic lists of tasks.
- **Maps** – used to associate each task with its completion status.
- **Functions** – used to separate logic into reusable components.
- **Packages** – used to modularize the application (via the `internal/taskmanager` package).
- **Loops** – infinite `for` loop to keep the app running until exit.
- **Switch statements** – for command selection and input control.
- **Error handling** – using Go's built-in `error` type and checking via `if` conditions.
