# ðŸ“š Learning Go
This little project is developed to help me learn Go programming language.

Projects in this repository:

`1_sheep_calc` - A silly program that calculates your sheep (unfortunately no user input). Uses logical operations and arithmetic operations.

`2_shape_area_calc` - A program that calculates the area of 3 shapes (circle, rectangle, and triangle) (unfortunately no user input). Uses struct and interface data types.

`3_task_manager` - A program that can help you manage your tasks. Uses slice and map data types, for loop, and logical operations.
